URL Shortener

This is a simple URL shortener service that allows users to convert long URLs into shorter, more manageable links. It's built with Go (Golang) and uses the Fiber web framework for the API. The service also utilizes Redis for rate limiting and storing short URL mappings.
I have used docker to containerize an application.
